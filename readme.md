 # AsteroidGameVita

A project I worked on in summer of 2018, a simple unfinished game with a vita and a linux port.
Due to what I can only presume to be a bug in SDL2_Vita, alternatively something I have missed,
when I loaded too many textures the vita port would crash. This was somewhat mitigated by resizing the textures making them smaller, but in the end I gave up on the project.

It uses Box2d, Imgui, and SDL2
